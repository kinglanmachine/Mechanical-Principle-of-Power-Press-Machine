The <a href="http://www.kinglanpress.com/products/mechanical-power-press/"/>power press machine</a> is driven by a motor through a transmission mechanism to exert technological force on the workpiece. The transmission mechanism is the deceleration mechanism of belt transmission and gear transmission, and the working mechanism is divided into screw mechanism, crank connecting rod mechanism and hydraulic cylinder.

Power press machines are divided into three categories: screw press, crank press and hydraulic press. Crank press is also called mechanical power press machine.

The screw power press machine has no fixed lower dead point. For larger die forgings, it can be formed by multiple strikes. It can be single, continuous beating and inch moving. The impact force is related to the deformation of the workpiece. When the deformation is large, the impact force is small, and when the deformation is small, such as cold shock, the impact force is large. In these respects, it is similar to forging hammer. But its impact force is closed through the frame, so it works smoothly, and its vibration is much smaller than that of the forging hammer, so it does not need a large foundation.

The lower part of the power press machine is equipped with a forging ejection device. The screw press has the functions of die forging hammer, mechanical press and other forging and pressing functions. It has strong versatility and can be used in die forging, blanking, drawing and other processes. In addition, the screw power press machine is widely used because of its simple structure and easy manufacture.
